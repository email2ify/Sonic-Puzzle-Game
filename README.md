<h2><Strong>Testing</strong></h2>

<ul>
<p>A Sonic picture cuts and resized in pieces and mixed on board1, hoping to be re-arrange on board2 with the correct main image of sonic adventure picture.
Dragging and dropping the image pieces on board2 and the result of the main sonic image turns out to be in the correct order. As view below.</p>
